# Property-Management-Analysis-Project

## Overview  
This project was my full journey of analyzing a **property dataset** â€” from raw messy data all the way to an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.  
It includes **data cleaning**, **exploration**, **RFM analysis**, **time-series analysis**, and **business insights** about property performance.

##  1. Data Cleaning & Exploration  
The first step was all about understanding and preparing the data.  
I used **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** to:
Ù„Ùˆ
- Handle missing and duplicated values  
- Convert date columns and normalize data types  
- Create new calculated columns (e.g. total price, client age, etc.)  
- Explore key trends and distributions

ðŸ“‚ **Dataset Folder:** [01_Dataset](01_Dataset)


The cleaned files were exported as CSVs and later used for the analysis stages.

##  2. RFM Analysis  
Next, I performed an **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis for both:

- **Clients** â€“ to segment customers based on activity and value  
- **Property Owners** â€“ to understand owner engagement and performance  

This helped identify **loyal clients**, **potential churners**, and **high-value owners**.  
I also visualized the RFM results to find patterns across user segments.

##  3. Sales Time Series Breakdown  
In this step, I analyzed **sales performance over time**.  
I broke down:

- Monthly sales trends  
- Seasonal patterns  
- Regional differences  
- Moving averages for better trend detection

##  4. Power BI Dashboard  
After the data and insights were ready, I built a **Power BI dashboard** that brings everything together visually.  

The dashboard includes:
- **Performance KPIs** (e.g. Occupancy Rate, Avg Commission %, DOM)  
- **Sales vs Rent comparison**  
- **Available, Sold, and Rented properties** over time  
- **Interactive filters** for deal type, year, and property category

Working on this project helped me strengthen my end-to-end data analysis skills â€” from cleaning and understanding raw data, to uncovering insights and visualizing them effectively.
